"""
MerchantShield AI backend entry point.

Startup behavior: loads the frozen model + explainer + metadata exactly once
(see services/model_loader.py) and opens the audit DB connection. If the model
artifact is missing or corrupt, this raises during startup -- the process will
not come up in a half-working state. If ONLY the model fails to load, /health
still comes up so orchestration tooling can see the degraded state and act on
it (this is deliberate: model_bundle is attached to app.state as None rather
than crashing the whole process, so the failure is visible via /health and
/model/info returns a clean 503 rather than every request 500ing).
