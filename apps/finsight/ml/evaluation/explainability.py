"""
Explainability layer for MerchantShield AI.

Uses shap.TreeExplainer on the frozen LightGBM model (unchanged from Phase 4/5).

GROUNDING RULE: every sentence produced by `humanize_contribution` is generated from
a (feature_name, observed_value, shap_value) triple that actually came out of the
explainer for that specific transaction. There is no free-text generation step, no
LLM call, and no template that fires without a real contribution behind it. If SHAP
says a feature didn't matter for this transaction, it does not appear in the output.
